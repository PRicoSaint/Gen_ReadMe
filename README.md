  ## Description:

    This project is a README.md generator. It will take the user input of name, description, license and other things to then generate a Readme.md using this information. This generator makes use of inquirer NPM package. While not perfect, it makes a great start to any project Readme. The user input is taken through the command line using node.js. Please see video for a walkthrough on functionality. An example has also been included in repo under GenReadMe_Example.md.
